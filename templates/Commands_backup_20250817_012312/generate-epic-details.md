# Determine epics to process based on parameters
if [ "$EPIC_PARAM" ]; then
    SELECTED_EPICS="$EPIC_PARAM"
elif [ "$PHASE_PARAM" ]; then
    SELECTED_EPICS=$(echo "$AVAILABLE_EPICS" | grep "^Epic $PHASE_PARAM\.")
else

echo "üîç Validating epic selection against MVP constraints..."
for epic in $SELECTED_EPICS; do
    EPIC_PRIORITY=$(get_epic_priority "$epic")
    if [ "$MVP_MODE" = "true" ] && [ "$EPIC_PRIORITY" -gt "$PRIORITY_CEILING" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Epic $epic (Priority $EPIC_PRIORITY) exceeds MVP ceiling ($PRIORITY_CEILING)"
        echo "üí° RECOMMENDATION: Complete foundation epics (Priority 0-3) first"
        SELECTED_EPICS=$(echo "$SELECTED_EPICS" | grep -v "$epic")
    fi
done

echo "üìã Validated epics for processing:"
echo "$SELECTED_EPICS"
```

### Phase 2: Integrated Epic Specification Generation

For each epic, generate comprehensive specifications using the integrated methodology:

#### **Epic Analysis and Generation Process with MVP Validation**

```markdown
# For each epic, perform integrated analysis with development ordering validation:

EPIC_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK:
  1. üö® MVP Constraint Validation:
     - Check epic priority against PRIORITY_CEILING
     - Validate against MVP_BLOCKED_FEATURES list
     - Ensure foundation dependencies are complete
     - Verify current development phase allows this epic
     
  2. Strategic Analysis:
     - Extract epic purpose and value from roadmap
     - Identify player-facing outcomes
     - Analyze dependencies and risks
     
  3. Technical Architecture:
     - Review TDS for technical requirements
     - Identify core systems and patterns
     - Analyze Unity-specific considerations
     - Map features to Unity Game Development Taxonomy
     
  4. Feature Decomposition:
     - Break epic into logical features
     - Ensure feature scope matches complexity level
     - Validate feature dependencies and integration
     - Check taxonomy priority mapping for each feature
     
  5. User Story Integration:
     - Create epic-level user story
     - Generate feature-level user stories
     - Ensure stories align with GDD player experience
```

```

### Phase 3: Epic Generation Logic

#### **Integrated Generation Process**

```bash
For each epic in SELECTED_EPICS:
  1. Extract Epic Metadata:
     - Parse epic ID, name, and duration from roadmap
     - Identify phase and priority level
     - Extract high-level description and goals
     
  2. Analyze Project Context:
     - Review GDD for player experience requirements
     - Analyze TDS for technical architecture needs
     - Consider complexity level constraints
     
  3. Feature Decomposition:
     - Break epic into logical feature groupings
     - Ensure features align with complexity constraints:
       * Simple: 2-3 features per epic
       * Intermediate: 3-4 features per epic  
       * Detailed: 4-6 features per epic
     - Validate feature scope and duration
     
  4. Generate User Stories:
     - Create epic-level user story capturing overall value
     - Generate feature-level user stories for specific benefits
     - Ensure stories align with GDD player personas
     
  5. Technical Architecture Analysis:
     - Identify core systems and patterns from TDS
     - Analyze Unity-specific requirements
     - Plan integration points and dependencies
     
  6. Create Comprehensive Specification:
     - Generate epic using integrated template
     - Include all architectural and user story elements
     - Validate against complexity and quality requirements
     
  7. Output and Validation:
     - Save to docs/epics/Epic-{ID}-Specification.md
     - Validate completeness and consistency
     - Report generation success and metrics
```

#### **Quality Assurance Integration**

```bash
# Automatic validation of generated epics
VALIDATION_CHECKS:
  - Epic duration matches roadmap allocation
  - Feature count appropriate for complexity level
  - All required sections present and complete
  - User stories follow proper format
  - Technical approach aligns with TDS
  - Dependencies are valid and achievable
  - Acceptance criteria are measurable
  
# Quality metrics reporting
QUALITY_METRICS:
  - Epic scope complexity assessment
  - Feature balance and distribution
  - Technical risk identification
  - Integration complexity analysis
```

### Phase 4: Linear Integration (Optional)

If `--create-linear-issues` flag is provided:

```bash
For each generated epic:
  Create Linear issue with:
    - Title: "Epic {ID}: {NAME} - {FEATURE_COUNT} Features"
    - Description: Complete epic specification
    - Labels: ["Epic", "Phase-{NUMBER}", complexity level]
    - Project: {from parameters or --linear-project}
    - Milestone: {phase milestone if applicable}
    
  Issue content includes:
    - Epic overview and user story
    - Complete feature breakdown

  Save to: {EPIC_OUTPUT_PATH}/Epic-{EPIC_ID}-Specification.md
  
# Generate comprehensive summary report
Epic Generation Complete
========================
Duration: {execution_time}
Complexity Level: {COMPLEXITY_LEVEL}

Generated Epics:
  ‚úÖ Epic {ID}: {NAME} ({feature_count} features, {duration} hours)
  {continue for all epics...}

Next Steps:
  1. Review generated epic specifications in docs/epics/
  2. Run 'validate-project-structure --epics' for quality validation
  3. Execute 'generate-feature-tasks --all' for detailed task breakdowns
  4. Check project roadmap alignment and dependencies
```

ERROR: GDD not found at ./docs/Project-GDD.md
RESOLUTION: Ensure GDD exists and project-parameters.yaml paths are correct
```

#### Invalid Epic Reference
```
ERROR: Epic 1.5 not found in roadmap
AVAILABLE: Epic 1.1, Epic 1.2, Epic 1.3, Epic 1.4
```

#### Insufficient Epic Detail
```
WARNING: Epic 1.2 has minimal description in roadmap
ACTION: Generating with enhanced analysis from available context
RECOMMENDATION: Update roadmap with more epic detail for better results
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### Command Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Project foundation
setup-game-project --project-name="MyGame"

# 2. Epic specifications (this command)
generate-epic-details --all --create-linear-issues

# 3. Feature task breakdowns
generate-feature-tasks --all

# 4. AI implementation prompts
generate-ai-prompts --all
```

### Status Checking
```bash
# Check which epics have specifications
generate-epic-details --status

# Show only incomplete epics

```

## Summary

This enhanced command generates comprehensive epic specifications by integrating strategic planning with technical architecture analysis. It combines user story methodology with Unity-specific technical requirements to create detailed, actionable epic documentation that serves as the foundation for all subsequent feature and task development.

The integrated approach eliminates external template dependencies while providing more thorough epic analysis and specification generation than previous approaches.
