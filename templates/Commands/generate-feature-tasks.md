### **TASK DEPENDENCY CHAIN**

**Visual Dependency Map:**
```
Task [X.Y.Z.1] ‚îÄ‚îê
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Task [X.Y.Z.3] ‚îÄ‚Üí Task [X.Y.Z.5] ‚îÄ‚Üí Feature Complete

#### **Mermaid UML Diagram Generation Guidelines**

```bash
# Feature-Specific Architecture Diagram Customization
MERMAID_DIAGRAM_GENERATION:
  class_diagram_customization:
    - Replace "FeatureMainClass" with actual primary class name from feature analysis
    - Add feature-specific methods and properties based on TDS requirements
    - Include Unity component types relevant to feature (MonoBehaviour, ScriptableObject, etc.)
    - Map external dependencies to specific systems from epic context
    - Add interfaces that feature must implement for integration
    - Include data structures specific to feature functionality
    
  component_flow_customization:
    - Map initialization steps to feature-specific setup requirements
    - Include feature-specific validation and error handling paths
    - Add runtime operations specific to feature's user interaction patterns
    - Include cleanup procedures relevant to feature's resource usage
    
  data_flow_customization:
    - Replace generic input sources with feature-specific data sources
    - Map processing steps to feature's core logic operations
    - Include feature-specific validation and transformation steps
    - Add output destinations relevant to feature's integration points
    - Include Unity-specific integration points (Scene, Assets, Events)

# Example Customization for NumberGenerator Feature:
EXAMPLE_CUSTOMIZATION:
  replace_generic_classes:
    FeatureMainClass -> NumberGenerator
    FeatureController -> NumberGeneratorController
    FeatureConfig -> NumberGeneratorConfig
    FeatureData -> GenerationParameters
    
  add_specific_methods:
    +GenerateNewTarget() int
    +EnableDebugMode(int) void
    +ValidateRange(int, int) bool
    +GetCurrentTarget() int
    
  include_dependencies:
    External Systems -> [GameStateManager, StatisticalValidator]
    Unity Components -> [Random, Debug, Events]

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Enhanced Diagnostics

#### Missing Epic Specifications
```bash
ERROR: Epic 1.1 specification not found at ./docs/epics/Epic-1.1-Specification.md
CONTEXT: Cannot generate feature tasks without epic context
RESOLUTION: Run 'generate-epic-details --epic 1.1' first
VALIDATION: Ensure epic contains proper feature breakdown section
```

#### Invalid Feature Reference
```bash
ERROR: Feature 1.1.5 not found in Epic 1.1 specification
AVAILABLE FEATURES: 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4
EPIC CONTEXT: Epic 1.1 defines 4 features, requested feature does not exist
RESOLUTION: Check epic specification for correct feature numbering
```

#### Insufficient Feature Detail
```bash
WARNING: Feature 1.2.2 has minimal description in Epic 1.2
IMPACT: Task breakdown will be generated with limited context
ACTION: Generating with enhanced analysis from GDD/TDS context
RECOMMENDATION: Update Epic 1.2 specification with more feature detail
CONTEXT_SOURCES: Falling back to GDD player requirements and TDS architecture
```

#### Context Integration Issues
```bash
WARNING: GDD context not found for Feature 1.1.1 player experience
IMPACT: Task breakdown will focus on technical implementation only
FALLBACK: Using epic-level user stories for player context
RECOMMENDATION: Enhance GDD with specific feature-level player requirements

WARNING: TDS architecture patterns not identified for Feature 1.2.3
IMPACT: Task breakdown will use generic Unity patterns
FALLBACK: Applying standard Unity component architecture
RECOMMENDATION: Update TDS with specific architectural guidance for this feature type
```

## Summary

This comprehensively enhanced command generates detailed feature task breakdowns by integrating multiple context sources (GDD, TDS, Epic specifications) with Unity-specific development expertise. It eliminates external template dependencies while providing significantly more thorough analysis, context integration, and implementation guidance than previous approaches.

The integrated methodology ensures that every task is properly contextualized within the player experience vision (GDD), technical architecture requirements (TDS), and strategic epic goals, while maintaining Unity best practices and complexity-appropriate scoping for efficient AI-assisted implementation.
