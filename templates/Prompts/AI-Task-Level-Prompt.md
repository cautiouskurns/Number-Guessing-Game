- **Unity Project Setup**: Verify project configuration matches requirements
- **MCP Integration**: Use Unity MCP tools for component and GameObject management

### **Performance Constraints:**
[Extract GC, memory, timing requirements from spec]

### **Architecture Guidelines:**
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - each class should have one clear purpose
- Keep class sizes manageable (prefer multiple focused classes over large monolithic ones)
- Only implement fields and methods explicitly required by the specification
- Avoid feature creep - don't add "nice to have" functionality not in requirements

## üîß Unity Integration

**GameObject Setup:** [Extract scene requirements, component attachments from spec]
**Scene Hierarchy:** [Extract parent containers, positioning from spec]
**Inspector Config:** [Extract serialized fields, headers, defaults from spec]

- [ ] [Specific functionality requirement from spec]
- [ ] [Specific functionality requirement from spec]
- [ ] [Integration checkpoint from spec]
- [ ] [Performance requirement from spec]
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Follows Unity best practices and Single Responsibility Principle

## üõ†Ô∏è Unity MCP Implementation

**üìñ Reference Documentation:**
- Unity MCP Implementation Guidelines: Follow established patterns for component creation and testing
- Project Parameters: Use `project-parameters.yaml` for Linear integration and Unity paths
- Execute Linear Command: Use updated workflow with comment-based completion tracking

**üîß Implementation Approach:**
Follow **[Extract Pattern Type]** pattern: [Extract specific implementation guidance from spec]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback Approach:**
If MCP unavailable, [Extract fallback strategy from spec or provide Unity-standard approach]

**üéØ MCP Integration Requirements:**
- **Unity State Management**: Ensure Unity exits play mode after any tests or validation
- **Component Integration**: Use `manage_gameobject` to attach components to appropriate GameObjects
- **Script Management**: Use `manage_script` for clean code creation with proper namespaces
- **Error Handling**: Check Unity console via `read_console` for compilation and runtime issues
- **Linear Integration**: Implementation will be tracked via Linear comments (preserves task descriptions)

### **MCP Priority Implementation:**

**Primary (Use When Available):**
- Use `manage_gameobject` to create GameObjects directly
- Use `manage_script` to create/update scripts  
- Use `manage_asset` for materials, prefabs, and ScriptableObjects
- Use `manage_scene` for scene hierarchy setup
- Validate setup with `read_console` for error checking

**Secondary (Fallback):**
- Create Editor setup script for team distribution
- Manual Unity Editor setup with detailed instructions
- Traditional workflow with validation steps

## üìÅ Deliverables

[Extract specific file paths and outputs from spec:]
- `[Extract Script Path]` - [Description from spec]
- `[Extract Asset Path]` - [Description from spec]

4. **Integration Notes** (brief explanation of how this integrates with other systems)

**File Structure:** [Extract paths, naming conventions from spec]
**Code Standards:** [Extract Unity conventions, documentation level from spec]

## üö® Resilience Flags

**StubMissingDeps:** [Extract from spec whether to create placeholder code for missing dependencies]
**ValidationLevel:** [Extract error checking depth from spec - None/Basic/Strict]  
**Reusability:** [Extract whether generic vs specific implementation from spec - OneOff/Reusable]

## üîç Dependency Handling

**Missing Dependencies:**
[Extract dependencies from spec and provide fallback instructions]
- **If [Dependency Class] is missing:** Create minimal stub with basic interface
- **If [Unity Component] is missing:** Log clear error with setup instructions  
- **If [Asset/ScriptableObject] is missing:** Create default configuration

**Fallback Behaviors:**
- Return safe default values for missing references
- Log informative warnings for configuration issues
- Gracefully degrade functionality rather than throwing exceptions
