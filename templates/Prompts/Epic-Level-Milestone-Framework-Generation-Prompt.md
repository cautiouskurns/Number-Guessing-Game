# Epic Level **Milestone Framework Generation Prompt**

You are an expert technical architect specializing in Unity game development project planning.

Analyze the provided GDD and TDS documents to create a focused epic specification that identifies features and their scope without over-engineering implementation details.

## üéØ TARGET EPIC:

**Epic to Detail:** [SPECIFY EPIC NAME AND NUMBER HERE - e.g., "Epic 1.2: Grid System"]

## üìê OUTPUT FORMAT:

---

# **EPIC [X.Y]: [EPIC_NAME]** *([Total Duration])*

## **Epic Overview**

### **Epic Statement (User Story)**
As a **[user type]**, I want **[high-level capability this epic provides]** so that **[value/benefit achieved]**.

| Epic Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Priority** | [Critical/High/Medium/Low] |
| **Risk Level** | [High/Medium/Low] |
| **Purpose** | [What this epic accomplishes and why it's essential for the game] |
| **Dependencies** | [What must be complete before this epic can begin] |
| **Estimated Effort** | [Total hours for the epic] |

**Playable State After Epic:** [What players can experience after this epic is complete]

**Definition of Done:**

## **Epic Integration**

**System Architecture:** [How the features in this epic work together]

**Dependencies on Other Epics:** [What this epic requires from other parts of the game]

**Provides to Other Epics:** [What this epic enables for future development]

## üìù GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

**Focus Areas:**

- Keep epic specs strategic and architectural rather than implementation-detailed
- Identify features and their scope without duplicating feature-to-task breakdown work
- Focus on what needs to be built and why, not how to build it
- Ensure features are properly scoped for the estimated durations
- Include enough context for feature breakdown but avoid over-specification

**Epic-Level Concerns:**

- Overall system architecture and how features fit together
- Dependencies between features and with other epics
- Player-facing outcomes and playable states
- Technical risk identification and mitigation approach
- Resource and time estimation for planning

**Avoid:**

- Detailed class specifications (leave for feature-to-task breakdown)
- Specific method signatures or implementation details
- Detailed Unity component configurations
- Asset specifications beyond high-level requirements
- Implementation sequences (handle at task level)

Generate focused epic specifications that enable effective feature planning without over-engineering implementation details.
