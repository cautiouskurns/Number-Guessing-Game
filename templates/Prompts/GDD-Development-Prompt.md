**GUIDANCE:** Be realistic about asset creation time. Each piece of content (level, character, environment) takes longer than expected. Plan for 20-30% fewer assets than you initially think you can create. Include production time estimates.

**FIELD EXPLANATIONS:**
- **World Scale**: Define the size and boundaries of your game world. Include technical constraints and scope limits that keep development manageable.
- **Content Boundaries**: Explicit list of content you will NOT create. This prevents scope creep and manages expectations during development.

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Include realistic time estimates per asset type (add 20% buffer)
- Account for iteration and polish time in estimates
- Define minimum viable content vs. ideal content
- List specific technical and creative limitations

| Scope Element | Definition | EXAMPLE FORMAT (Replace with your scope limits) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **World Scale** | [Your game world size, boundaries, and constraints] | **Playable Space:**<br>- [Dimension/size]: [Specific measurements/limits]<br>- [View options]: [X] levels ([describe each])<br>- Total unique [units]: [X] ([organization method])<br><br>**Scope Limits:**<br>- No [limitation 1]<br>- No [limitation 2]<br>- [Fixed constraint]<br><br>**Production Time:**<br>- Per [asset type]: [X] hours<br>- Per [asset type]: [X] hours<br>- Per [asset type]: [X] hours<br>- Total: [X] hours for all [content] |
| **Content Boundaries** | [Your explicit list of content NOT included] | **NOT Creating:**<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([reason/alternative])<br>- [Content type] ([timing/scope reason])<br>- [Content type] ([alternative approach]) |

### **5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS** *(How do we build this?)*

**PURPOSE:** Define all technical specifications needed for development. This section directly informs tool choices, AI coding prompts, and technical task planning.

### **5.1 Platform & Performance**

**GUIDANCE:** Choose platforms based on target audience and technical capabilities. Performance targets should be achievable with your technical skills. Consider platform-specific constraints (mobile battery, web file size limits, etc.). Include specific hardware targets and optimization strategies.

**FIELD EXPLANATIONS:**
- **Target Platforms**: Primary and secondary platforms with specific technical requirements. Include distribution channels, minimum specs, and input requirements.
- **Performance Targets**: Measurable performance goals for frame rate, loading times, and build sizes. Must be achievable on minimum specifications.
- **Platform Constraints**: Specific limitations and optimization strategies for each platform. Include memory limits, battery life, cross-platform considerations.

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- List specific device models and minimum specifications
- Include measurable performance metrics (FPS, loading times, file sizes)
- Define acceptable quality settings and fallback options
- Plan for optimization strategies and technical constraints

| Platform | Requirements | EXAMPLE FORMAT (Replace with your platform targets) |

### **5.2 Technology Stack**

**GUIDANCE:** Choose tools you know or can learn quickly. Avoid changing engines mid-project. External libraries should solve specific problems and be well-documented. Data storage format affects save/load complexity. Include version numbers and licensing considerations.

**FIELD EXPLANATIONS:**
- **Engine & Tools**: Core development engine, IDE, version control, and production tools. Include specific versions and licensing costs.

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Specify exact versions for reproducible builds
- Note all licensing costs and budget impact
- Include backup alternatives for critical tools
- Plan for version migration and compatibility

| Category | Tools & Libraries | EXAMPLE FORMAT (Replace with your technology choices) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Engine & Tools** | [Your core development stack] | **Engine: [Engine Name] [Version]**<br>- Version: [Specific version] ([stability reason])<br>- Render: [Rendering pipeline]<br>- License: [License type] ([cost/limitation])<br><br>**Development Tools:**<br>- IDE: [Name] ([cost])<br>- Version Control: [System] + [Service] ([cost])<br>- Task Tracking: [Tool] ([tier/cost])<br>- Art: [Tool] ([cost]) + [Tool] ([cost])<br>- Audio: [Tool] ([cost]) |

### **6. DEVELOPMENT PLANNING** *(How do we ship this?)*

**PURPOSE:** Transform the game vision into executable development plan. Provides roadmap for AI-assisted development and prevents endless polishing by defining clear completion criteria.

### **6.1 Scope Management**

**GUIDANCE:** Use MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't have). Must-haves create minimum viable product. Won't-haves prevent scope creep. Focus on shipping a complete experience rather than perfect features. Include specific feature lists with time estimates.

**PRIORITY LEVEL EXPLANATIONS:**
- **Must-Have**: Features absolutely required for the game to function and ship. Without these, the game is not playable or sellable. This is your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- **Should-Have**: Important features that significantly enhance the experience but aren't required for launch. Add these if time permits within scope.
- **Could-Have**: Nice-to-have features that would be good additions but don't affect core experience. Only add if ahead of schedule.
- **Won't-Have**: Features explicitly cut to prevent scope creep. Document these to avoid adding them back during development.

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Order by implementation dependency
- Include effort estimates (hours) - be realistic and add 20% buffer
- Mark technical prerequisites
- Group related features together

| Priority Level | Features | EXAMPLE FORMAT (Replace with your features) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Must-Have** | [Core features required to ship] | **Core Gameplay (140 hours)**<br>- Node connection system (40h)<br>- Power flow calculation (20h)<br>- 25 campaign levels (50h)<br>- Save/load system (10h)<br>- Basic UI/menus (20h)<br><br>**Polish (40 hours)**<br>- Sound effects (10h)<br>- Visual feedback (15h)<br>- Tutorial levels (10h)<br>- Bug fixing (5h) |
| **Should-Have** | [Important enhancements] | **Enhanced Experience (60 hours)**<br>- Level selection map (10h)<br>- Statistics tracking (10h)<br>- Settings menu (10h)<br>- 3-star rating system (10h)<br>- Particle effects (10h)<br>- Background music (10h) |
| **Could-Have** | [Nice additions if time allows] | **Nice Additions (40 hours)**<br>- Challenge levels (15h)<br>- Achievements (10h)<br>- Leaderboards (10h)<br>- Colorblind mode (5h)<br>- Additional themes (20h)<br>- Hint system (10h) |
| **Won't-Have** | [Explicitly excluded to prevent scope creep] | **Explicitly Excluded**<br>- Level editor (future DLC)<br>- Multiplayer (too complex)<br>- Procedural generation (design choice)<br>- Voice acting (budget)<br>- Cutscenes (scope)<br>- Multiple save slots (unnecessary)<br>- Steam Workshop (post-launch)<br>- Mobile launch (6 months later) |

### **6.2 Validation Approach**

**GUIDANCE:** Define specific, testable criteria for each milestone and overall success. This prevents endless polishing and provides clear gates for moving to the next phase. Include both technical validation (does it work?) and experience validation (is it fun?). Add specific test cases and metrics.

**FIELD EXPLANATIONS:**
- **Milestone Validation**: Specific criteria for Alpha, Beta, and Gold milestones. Include technical functionality, bug counts, performance targets, and user feedback requirements.
- **Success Criteria**: Overall success metrics for technical performance, gameplay engagement, and commercial viability. Must be measurable and achievable.

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Include quantifiable metrics for all validation criteria
- Define specific test procedures and acceptance thresholds
- Set achievable ranges based on realistic expectations
- Balance technical metrics with user experience indicators

| Validation Type | Method | EXAMPLE FORMAT (Replace with your validation criteria) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Milestone Validation** | [How you'll know each milestone is complete] | **[Milestone 1] ([Timeline]):**<br>- [Criteria 1]: [Specific measurable requirement]<br>- [Criteria 2]: [Specific measurable requirement]<br>- [Criteria 3]: [Specific measurable requirement]<br>- [User feedback]: "[Target feedback quality]"<br><br>**[Milestone 2] ([Timeline]):**<br>- [Criteria 1]: [Specific measurable requirement]<br>- [Criteria 2]: [Specific measurable requirement]<br>- [Criteria 3]: [Specific measurable requirement]<br>- [User feedback]: "[Target feedback quality]"<br><br>**[Final Milestone] ([Timeline]):**<br>- [Criteria 1]: [Zero tolerance requirement]<br>- [Criteria 2]: [Completion requirement]<br>- [Criteria 3]: [Quality requirement]<br>- [Market readiness]: [Launch readiness criteria] |
| **Success Criteria** | [What defines your working, shippable game] | **Technical Success:**<br>- [Metric 1]: <[X]% of [measurement]<br>- [Metric 2]: <[X] seconds<br>- [Metric 3]: [X]% [reliability target]<br>- [Metric 4]: [X]+ FPS on [specification]<br><br>**Gameplay Success:**<br>- [Engagement metric]: >[X]% of players<br>- [Retention metric]: >[X]% reach [milestone]<br>- [Session metric]: [X]+ minutes average<br>- [Behavior metric]: >[X]% [positive behavior]<br><br>**Commercial Success:**<br>- [Quality metric]: >[X]% positive<br>- [Business metric]: <[X]% [negative outcome]<br>- [Sales metric]: [X]+ units in [timeframe]<br>- [Financial metric]: Break even within [timeframe] |
