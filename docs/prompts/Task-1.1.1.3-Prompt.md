### **Dependencies:**
Tasks 1.1.1.1 (Core NumberGenerator) and 1.1.1.2 (Debug Mode) must be complete, mathematical libraries for statistical calculations, Unity Editor scripting for menu integration.

**üìã Task Dependencies:**
- **Prerequisites**: Tasks 1.1.1.1 (Core NumberGenerator) and 1.1.1.2 (Debug Mode) provide foundation and deterministic testing
