## üéØ Task Overview
**Task ID:** 1.1.1.2 | **Priority:** High | **Duration:** 3 hours  
**Feature:** 1.1.1 - Random Number Generation System | **Epic:** 1.1 - Core Game Logic System | **Category:** 7.3 Debug Systems

## üéÆ Game Context

This task builds upon the core NumberGenerator to add debug infrastructure that enables deterministic testing scenarios through seed control. This supports development quality assurance ensuring the "Pure Logic" pillar functions correctly by enabling thorough testing of gameplay scenarios without randomness interference. The debug system provides Unity Editor integration for easy access during development and comprehensive quality assurance validation.

- **Project Parameters**: `project-parameters.yaml` - Configuration and team settings

## üìã Task Requirements

- Debug mode toggle functionality with conditional compilation for Editor-only features
- Seed setting capability for deterministic generation in testing scenarios
- Unity Editor menu items providing easy debug access for development team
- Validation ensuring debug mode produces identical sequences with same seed
- Performance impact assessment ensuring debug features don't affect release builds
- Debug logging provides clear information about current seed and generation state

## üéØ Expected Outcome

After implementation, developers should see:
- **Visual Outcome**: Debug mode controls in Unity Inspector and Editor menu items for easy access
- **Functional Outcome**: Deterministic number generation when debug mode enabled with fixed seeds
- **Integration Outcome**: Debug infrastructure seamlessly integrated with existing NumberGenerator singleton
- **Performance Outcome**: Zero performance impact in release builds through conditional compilation

**Verification**: Enable debug mode with seed 12345, generate 10 numbers, restart Unity, generate 10 more numbers with same seed and verify identical sequences

## üîß Implementation Steps

1. **Add Debug Mode Fields**: Extend NumberGenerator with debug mode toggle and seed configuration fields
2. **Implement Conditional Compilation**: Use #if UNITY_EDITOR directives to ensure debug features only exist in Editor builds
3. **Create Seed Management**: Add methods for setting custom seeds and switching between random/deterministic modes
4. **Add Editor Menu Integration**: Create MenuItem attributes for Unity Editor menu access to debug controls
5. **Implement Debug Logging**: Add configurable debug logging showing current mode, seed values, and generation state
6. **Add Validation Methods**: Create methods to verify deterministic behavior and seed consistency

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Specification

### **Class Structure:**
```csharp
public class NumberGenerator : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Existing singleton and generation code...
    
    [Header("Debug Configuration")]
    #if UNITY_EDITOR
    [SerializeField] private bool isDebugMode = false;
    [SerializeField] private int debugSeed = 12345;
    [SerializeField] private bool enableDebugLogging = true;
    #endif
    
    #if UNITY_EDITOR
    public bool IsDebugMode => isDebugMode;
    public int DebugSeed => debugSeed;
    
    [MenuItem("NumberGuessingGame/Debug/Toggle Debug Mode")]
    public static void ToggleDebugMode() { /* Implementation */ }
    
    [MenuItem("NumberGuessingGame/Debug/Set Debug Seed")]
    public static void SetDebugSeedDialog() { /* Implementation */ }
    #endif
}
```

### **Core Logic:**
Debug infrastructure enabling deterministic testing through seed control, with conditional compilation ensuring Editor-only availability and zero impact on release builds.

### **Dependencies:**
Task 1.1.1.1 (Core NumberGenerator) must be complete, Unity Editor scripting APIs, conditional compilation understanding.

**üìã Task Dependencies:**
- **Prerequisites**: Task 1.1.1.1 (Core NumberGenerator) must provide base singleton functionality
- **Blocks**: Task 1.1.1.3 (Statistical Validation) needs debug mode for deterministic testing
- **Related Systems**: QA testing workflows, development debugging processes

**üîó Implementation Context:**
- **Existing Codebase**: Extend existing NumberGenerator class without breaking existing functionality
- **Unity Project Setup**: Ensure conditional compilation works correctly across different build configurations
- **MCP Integration**: Use Unity MCP tools for Editor script management and validation

### **Performance Constraints:**
Zero performance impact in release builds, minimal overhead in Editor for debug features, efficient seed management without memory allocation.

### **Architecture Guidelines:**
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - debug features enhance but don't complicate core generation
- Keep debug code cleanly separated through conditional compilation
- Only implement debug functionality explicitly required by testing scenarios
- Avoid debug feature creep that complicates core logic
- Align with TDS testing philosophy emphasizing reliable, debuggable systems

## üîß Unity Integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Unity MCP Implementation

**üìñ Reference Documentation:**
- Unity MCP Implementation Guidelines: Follow established patterns for component creation and testing

Verify debug features integrate seamlessly with existing NumberGenerator functionality, confirm Editor menu items work correctly, test conditional compilation exclusion in builds.

**Performance Validation:**
Confirm zero performance impact in release builds through build testing, measure debug overhead in Editor to ensure minimal impact on development workflow.

**Epic Alignment Validation:**
Ensure debug infrastructure supports Epic 1.1 testing requirements and quality assurance processes for random number generation validation.
