- [ ] Accurate "Higher", "Lower", or "Correct!" feedback for all guess scenarios
- [ ] Attempt counter updates accurately and triggers game over at maximum attempts
- [ ] Input field behavior supports both keyboard entry and potential UI number picker

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
```csharp
public class InputManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Input Configuration")]
    public TMP_InputField numberInputField;
    public Button submitButton;
    public int maxAttempts = 10;
    
    [Header("Validation Feedback")]
    public TextMeshProUGUI validationText;
    public Color validColor = Color.green;
    public Color invalidColor = Color.red;
    
    // Input validation methods
    // Guess processing logic
    // UI feedback coordination
    // Attempt tracking
}

public struct GuessResult
{
    public int GuessValue;
    public GuessOutcome Outcome;
    public string FeedbackText;
    public int AttemptsRemaining;

- Event system for state change notifications to all dependent systems
- State-based behavior coordination for UI, input, and audio systems
- Game session management with automatic state progression and reset capabilities
- Win/lose condition detection with proper game ending logic

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Clear state transitions from Menu → Playing → Won/Lost → Menu cycle
- [ ] Win condition triggers when correct number is guessed with celebration feedback
- [ ] Lose condition triggers at maximum attempts with game over screen and answer reveal
- [ ] All game systems respond appropriately to state changes (UI updates, input enable/disable)
- [ ] New game functionality properly resets all systems and generates fresh target number

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
```csharp
public class GameStateManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static GameStateManager Instance { get; private set; }
    
    [Header("Game State")]
    public GameState currentState = GameState.Menu;
    
    [Header("Win/Lose Configuration")]
    public int maxAttempts = 10;
    public float celebrationDuration = 3f;
    
    // State transition methods
    // Win/lose condition checking
    // Event coordination
    // System reset functionality
}

public enum GameState
{
    Menu,           // Main menu, settings, before game starts
    Playing,        // Active gameplay with number guessing
    Won,           // Player guessed correctly, celebration state
    Lost           // Player exceeded attempts, game over state
}
```

**Feature Dependencies:**
- **Prerequisites:** Features 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 provide number generation and guess processing
