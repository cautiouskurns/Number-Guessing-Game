## **1. GAME IDENTITY** *(What is this game?)*

### **1.1 Core Concept**

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Game Overview** | Number Guessing Game is a casual puzzle game where players deduce a hidden number through strategic guessing and feedback analysis. |
| **Genre & Platform** | Primary: Casual Puzzle<br>Secondary: Educational/Logic<br>Platforms: PC (Windows/Mac/Linux), Mobile (iOS/Android future) |
| **Unique Value Proposition** | Pure strategy-based deduction without time pressure, focusing on logical thinking and efficient problem-solving rather than quick reflexes or complex mechanics. |

### **1.2 Design Pillars** *(Maximum 3)*

1. **"Pure Logic"** 
   - Description: Every guess provides meaningful information that skilled players can use to optimize their strategy. No random elements affect the solving process.
   - Implementation: Binary search hints, feedback consistency, mathematical optimization rewards
   - Decision Filter: "Does this feature reward logical thinking over luck or speed?"

2. **"Immediate Clarity"** 
   - Description: Players instantly understand their progress and next optimal moves without confusion or hidden information.
   - Feedback: Clear "Higher/Lower" responses, attempt tracking, range visualization
   - Decision Filter: "Can a new player immediately understand what this feedback means?"

3. **"Satisfying Progress"** 
   - Description: Each attempt brings visible progress toward the solution with meaningful accomplishment milestones.
   - Implementation: Best score tracking, attempt efficiency rating, strategy improvement feedback
   - Decision Filter: "Does this make players feel smarter and more accomplished?"

## **2. GAMEPLAY & SYSTEMS** *(What can the game do?)*

### **2.1 Gameplay Mechanics**

| Mechanic Type | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Primary Mechanics** | **1. Number Input (Every 10-15 seconds)**<br>- Input: Type number 1-100 or use number picker<br>- Validation: Range check (1-100), integer only<br>- Feedback: Input field highlights green/red for valid/invalid<br>- Constraints: Must be within range to submit<br><br>**2. Guess Submission (Every 15-20 seconds)**<br>- Input: Click Submit button or press Enter<br>- Response: Immediate feedback with sound/visual cue<br>- Validation: Updates attempt counter, processes guess<br>- Feedback: "Higher," "Lower," or "Correct!" with celebration |
| **Secondary Mechanics** | **1. Game Reset**<br>- Trigger: "New Game" button or after win/loss<br>- Function: Generates new target number, resets counters<br>- Feedback: Clear all previous guesses, reset UI state<br><br>**2. Hint System**<br>- Trigger: Optional hint button (limited uses)<br>- Function: Shows remaining range or optimal strategy tip<br>- Cost: Uses one of 3 available hints per game |
| **Victory/Failure Conditions** | **Victory Conditions:**<br>- Guess the exact target number<br>- Display attempts taken and congratulate player<br>- Update best score if new personal record<br><br>**Failure States:**<br>- Reach 10 attempts without correct guess<br>- Show "Game Over" with correct answer revealed<br>- Option to try again with same or new number |

### **2.2 Systems & Features**

| System Category | Components |
| --- | --- |
| **Core Systems** | **Random Number Generation**<br>- Algorithm: Unity's Random.Range(1, 101)<br>- Seed: System time for unpredictability<br>- Testing mode: Fixed seed for validation<br><br>**Guess Validation System**<br>- Input parsing: String to integer conversion<br>- Range validation: 1-100 bounds checking<br>- Duplicate detection: Track previous guesses<br><br>**Score Tracking System**<br>- Local storage: PlayerPrefs for best scores<br>- Data tracked: Fewest attempts, total games, win rate<br>- Persistence: Survives game restarts |
| **Core Features** | **Game State Management**<br>- States: Menu, Playing, Won, Lost<br>- Transitions: Clear state boundaries with animations<br>- UI adaptation: Different UI layouts per state<br><br>**Feedback Display**<br>- Guess history: Scrollable list of previous attempts<br>- Range visualization: Visual indicator of remaining possibilities<br>- Progress tracking: Attempt counter with visual progress bar<br><br>**Settings Menu**<br>- Audio: Master volume, SFX on/off<br>- Gameplay: Hint availability, difficulty (future)<br>- Display: Fullscreen toggle, resolution options |
