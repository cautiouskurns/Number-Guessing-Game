# **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP: "Number Guessing Game"**

> **Generated using High-Level Milestone Framework**
> **Complexity Level:** Simple
> **Generated:** 2025-08-16
> **⚠️ Parameter Validation:** ✅ PASSED - Simple complexity with 1 phase confirmed

---

## **Project Summary**

**Game Type:** Casual puzzle game with logical deduction mechanics - players deduce hidden numbers through strategic guessing

**Development Time:** 3-4 months part-time (130 hours total)

**Platform:** PC (Windows/Mac/Linux) primary, with mobile-ready architecture

**Key Challenge:** Creating satisfying progression through pure logical thinking without time pressure or complex mechanics

---

## **DEVELOPMENT PHASES**

### **PHASE 1: TECHNICAL MVP** *(6 weeks - 130 hours total)*

**Goal:** Prove core systems work technically - validate that the number guessing logic and feedback systems function correctly

**Validation:** Random number generation, input validation, and deterministic feedback systems operate reliably with consistent results

**Playable State:** Players can enter numbers 1-100, receive accurate "Higher/Lower/Correct" feedback, and complete games with win/lose outcomes clearly displayed. Game is feature-complete and ready for use as a learning project or portfolio piece.

**Key Epics:**

- **Epic 1.1: Core Game Logic System** *(50 hours)* - Random number generation, guess validation, feedback calculation, and game state management working reliably
- **Epic 1.2: Complete UI & Input System** *(50 hours)* - Full interface with number input, feedback display, statistics tracking, and settings menu
- **Epic 1.3: Polish & Final Integration** *(30 hours)* - Audio feedback, visual polish, performance optimization, and final testing

---

## **MILESTONE VALIDATION**

**Technical MVP Success Criteria:**
- Random number generation produces numbers 1-100 consistently across 1000+ test runs
- Input validation prevents all invalid submissions and provides clear feedback
- Game state transitions work reliably with proper win/lose detection in all scenarios
- Complete UI responds to all player actions within 200ms
- Statistics persistence works across game sessions without data loss
- Performance maintains 60fps during all gameplay scenarios on target hardware
- Zero critical bugs discovered in 100+ complete gameplay sessions

**Project Completion Criteria:**
- All core gameplay features implemented and tested
- Professional presentation quality appropriate for portfolio use
- Code is well-documented and maintainable
- Game provides satisfying logical challenge with clear progression

**Critical Path:** 
Core logic system → UI integration → state management → statistics & persistence → audio & polish → performance optimization → final testing

**Biggest Risk:** 
Gameplay becoming repetitive without sufficient feedback systems. **Mitigation:** Focus on satisfying feedback loops, clear progress indicators, and achievement recognition during Epic 1.2 development.

## **SIMPLE COMPLEXITY OPTIMIZATIONS**

**Focus Areas:**
- **Technical MVP Only** - Single phase proves concept and creates complete playable experience
- **Learning Project Scope** - Emphasis on understanding Unity fundamentals rather than commercial features
- **Unity Built-in Systems** - Leverage existing Unity UI, Input System, and PlayerPrefs rather than custom frameworks
- **Portfolio Ready** - Professional quality code and presentation suitable for demonstrating development skills

**Development Approach:**
- **Front-loaded Risk** - All technical challenges addressed in single comprehensive phase
- **Iterative Refinement** - Build core functionality first, then polish and optimize
- **Clear Validation Gates** - Each epic has specific success criteria for measuring progress
- **Solo Developer Optimized** - Realistic timeline and scope for single developer working part-time

**Excluded Features (Scope Management):**
- Multiple difficulty levels or game modes
- Online leaderboards or multiplayer functionality  
- Complex animations or visual effects systems
- Tutorial system (game should be immediately intuitive)
- Achievement systems beyond basic statistics
- Custom audio mixing or complex sound design

**Success Definition:**
A complete, polished number guessing game that demonstrates:
1. **Technical Competence** - Clean code architecture and proper Unity integration
2. **Design Understanding** - Clear gameplay loop with satisfying feedback
3. **Polish Capability** - Professional presentation and user experience
4. **Project Management** - Delivered on time and within scope

---

## **EPIC BREAKDOWN SUMMARY**

**Total Epics:** 3 (Technical MVP phase only)
**Development Timeline:** Single 6-week phase with clear milestones
**Validation Approach:** Technical validation → Complete gameplay → Final polish

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Complete project documentation suite (GDD, TDS, Roadmap)
2. Generate detailed epic specifications: `generate-epic-details --all`
3. Begin development with Epic 1.1 (Core Game Logic System)
4. Maintain focus on simple complexity constraints throughout development
