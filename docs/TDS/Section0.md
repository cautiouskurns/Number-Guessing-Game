## **0. DESIGN TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK** *(Critical - Maps design to implementation)*

### **0.1 GDD Decision â†’ Technical Requirements Mapping**

**For Number Guessing Game (Casual Puzzle):**

| GDD Design Decision | Technical Implementation | Why This Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **"Pure strategy-based deduction without time pressure, focusing on logical thinking"** | No timer systems, synchronous turn-based logic, deterministic feedback algorithms | Eliminates real-time performance pressure on both player and system, allowing simplified architecture focused on logical validation rather than timing optimization |
| **"Players instantly understand their progress and next optimal moves without confusion"** | Immediate UI feedback (<100ms response), clear state transitions, visual feedback system with consistent patterns | Creates responsive feel through technical responsiveness rather than complex animations, requiring minimal rendering pipeline but precise timing |
| **"Each attempt brings visible progress toward the solution with meaningful accomplishment"** | Persistent state tracking, progressive disclosure UI systems, statistical data collection and display | Requires robust data persistence and state management to maintain player progress and achievement tracking across sessions |
| **"Must run on 5-year-old hardware with 60 FPS stable performance"** | Minimal graphics processing, UI-focused rendering pipeline, optimized memory management | Drives architectural decisions toward CPU-based logic over GPU-intensive graphics, emphasizing clean algorithms over visual complexity |
| **"Simple state management (Playing, Won, Lost)"** | Finite state machine with clear transitions, minimal state complexity, event-driven architecture | Enables predictable behavior and simplified debugging while maintaining clear separation of concerns |

### **0.2 Genre-Specific Translation Patterns**

**Casual Puzzle Game Pattern Applied:**

- **Logic Validation Priority**: Clean separation between game rules and presentation layer, with deterministic algorithms for guess validation and feedback generation
- **Immediate Response Feedback**: Event-driven UI updates with instant visual/audio feedback, prioritizing user experience over complex visual effects
- **Simple Data Management**: Lightweight save/load system for progress tracking, focusing on reliability over complex persistence features

### **0.3 Design Constraint Analysis Framework**

| Constraint | Architectural Impact | Implementation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **130 hours development time (3-4 months part-time)** | Eliminates complex architecture patterns, favors Unity built-in systems over custom solutions | Use Unity UI Canvas system, built-in input management, PlayerPrefs for persistence, avoid custom frameworks |
| **Solo developer with intermediate Unity skills** | Architecture must be maintainable by single person, self-documenting code patterns | Favor composition over inheritance, clear naming conventions, minimal external dependencies, Unity design patterns |
| **PC primary, mobile secondary platforms** | Input system must handle both mouse/keyboard and touch, performance scalable across device types | Unity's new Input System for cross-platform input, responsive UI scaling, performance profiling for mobile constraints |
| **Must-have features only (80 hours core gameplay)** | Technical architecture supports only essential systems, no over-engineering for future features | Monolithic game manager pattern, direct component communication, minimal abstraction layers until needed |
| **<100MB build size on PC, <50MB on mobile** | Asset optimization crucial, minimal texture/audio assets, efficient code compilation | Sprite atlasing, compressed audio, code stripping, minimal external libraries, Unity's built-in compression |
